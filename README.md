# BashScript
Small Bash Script Application

Applications created on Linux shell. 

TeaProblme.sh asks the user if they want tea, insisting on it if the answer is no - Until, after 5 iterations, giving up. Not much practical use, but a fun little incursion on bash/shell scripting.

AutomatedScript.sh automates a list of Linux shell commands to be executed at the same time.

Used an AWS virtual Linux machine to develop both applications.
