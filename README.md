# BashScript
Small Bash Script Application

Application created on Linux shell. It asks the user if they want tea, insisting on it if the answer is no - Until, after 5 iterations, giving up.

Not much practical use, but a fun little incursion on bash/shell scripting.

Used an AWS virtual Linux machine to develop it.
